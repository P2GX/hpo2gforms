# Evaluation

As mentioned in the [tutorial](tutorial.md), participants respond to the items of a questionnaire as a Google form. 
The responses of all participants are recorded by the Google software, and can be visualized there. After all participants have entered their
responses or the deadline has passed, the responses are exported to a Google sheet. The sheet is then downloaded to the project respository as
a tab-separated value file.

TODO -- add a command to this application to summarize responses of such a sheet.


TODO -- add a Figure with an example output of the evaluation.


This summary is then provided to the orgnaizing committee, who will process the responsees as described in [Delphi](delphi.md).
