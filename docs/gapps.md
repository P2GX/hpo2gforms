# Google Apps


## Running scripts
Open a google form in Google. Go to the ellipsis (three dots) on the upper right and open the scripting console.
Paste in code that we generated using this application.

In the Google environment, save the code. If there are no syntax errors,
the run button will be activated. Click it. It may take a few minutes for
the Google form to be generated.

To find the created form, one can use the "Recent" button in one's 
Google Drive account.
